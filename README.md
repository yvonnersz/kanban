# BACKGROUND
  As a team lead of a company, you are responsible for keeping track of the physical inventory to make sure your team has enough raw materials to run its process for the day. Instead of having to run back and forth to the warehouse to physically count the inventory, you and the other team leads have decided to keep track of all inventories online! As a team leader/user, you will be able to create, read, update, and delete a selected chemical to accurately reflect the physical inventory for your team.
